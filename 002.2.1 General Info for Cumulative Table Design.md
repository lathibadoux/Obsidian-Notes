1. Core Components
	* 2 dataframes (yesterday and today)
	* Columns in the two dataframes should be the same
	* FULL OUTER JOIN the two data frames together
	* COALESCE values to keep everything around.
		* User might only exist in one table
	* Hang onto all of the history
	* Need to have some sort of filtration to prune out unneeded values
2. Usages
	* Growth analytics at Facebook (dim_all_users)
	* State transition tracking
	* Very common for creating Master Data
3. Strengths
	* Amazing ability to do historical analysis without shuffle (i.e. GROUP BY)
	* Easy "transition" analysis
4. Drawbacks
	* Can only be backfilled sequentially
	* Handling PII data can be a mess since deleted/inactive users get carried forward

### The compactness vs usability tradeoff
1. The most usable tables usually
	* Have no complex data types
	* Easily can be manipulated with WHERE and GROUP BY
2. The most compact tables (not human readable)
	* Are compressed to be as small as possible and can't be queried directly until they're decoded
3. The middle-ground tables
	* Use complex data types (i.e. ARRAY, MAP and STRUCT), making querying trickier but also compacting more
