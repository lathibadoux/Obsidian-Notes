## Definition
A **clustered index** is a type of database index where the table’s **actual data rows are stored in the order of the index key**. Think of it like a *phone book*, like the *table of contents* in a book.

## Key Points
1. **Physical order matches index order**
    - The rows on disk are arranged to match the clustered index key order.
    - This is different from a nonclustered index, which just stores pointers to where the data lives.
2.  **Only one per table**
    - Since the clustered index dictates how the table’s data is physically stored, you can only have **one** clustered index per table.
    - (You _can_ have many nonclustered indexes.)
3. **Fast for range queries**
    - If you query a range (`WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-01-31'`), the rows are already in order, so the database can read them sequentially without jumping around.
4. **Usually built on primary key**
    - Many databases automatically make the primary key the clustered index unless told otherwise.

## Example Code
-- Creating a clustered index

`CREATE TABLE Orders (`
    `OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,      -- Becomes clustered index`
    `CustomerID INT,`
    `OrderDate DATE`
`);`
