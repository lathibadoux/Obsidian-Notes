Employees can belong to multiple departments. When the employee joins other departments, they need to decide which department is their primary department. Note that when an employee belongs to only one department, their primary column is `'N'`.

Write a solution to report all the employees with their primary department. For employees who belong to one department, report their only department.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 
Employee table:
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| employee_id | department_id | primary_flag |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| 1           | 1             | N            |
| 2           | 1             | Y            |
| 2           | 2             | N            |
| 3           | 3             | N            |
| 4           | 2             | N            |
| 4           | 3             | Y            |
| 4           | 4             | N            |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
**Output:** 
+-------------+---------------+
| employee_id | department_id |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 1             |
| 2           | 1             |
| 3           | 3             |
| 4           | 3             |
+-------------+---------------+

**Fastest:**
```sql
-- Pick the 'Y' row if it exists; otherwise the only row
WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT employee_id, department_id,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
           PARTITION BY employee_id
           ORDER BY CASE WHEN primary_flag = 'Y' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END
         ) AS rn
  FROM Employee
)
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM ranked
WHERE rn = 1;
```



```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'
   OR employee_id IN (
       SELECT employee_id
       FROM Employee
       GROUP BY employee_id
       HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
   );
```

- `OR ... IN` means the database can evaluate in a **single scan** of `Employee`.
- The subquery produces only the list of employees with a single department. That’s usually small compared to the full table.
- No deduplication step is needed, since a given `(employee_id, department_id)` can’t appear in both conditions simultaneously (`primary_flag = 'Y'` vs. "has only one department").
- Optimizers often turn this into a **semi-join** plan (exists/in check) which is efficient.

```sql
select employee_id, department_id

from Employee

group by employee_id

having count(*)=1

union all

select employee_id, department_id

from Employee

where primary_flag = 'Y'

group by employee_id

```
