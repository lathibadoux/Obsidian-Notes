1. ==**Stashing = temporarily saving your uncommitted changes outside your working directory**== so you can switch branches, pull updates, or do other Git operations *without losing or committing* your local edits.
	* Stored inside your local repository's hidden `.git` folder.
	* Git normally only saves tracked changes.  Untracked changes will only be saved if explicitly called out by the flag `-u`.
	* Always add a message by the flag `-m`.
* Reasons to stash:
	* You want to **pull/rebase** your branch, but have local edits that would conflict.
	* You need to **switch branches** quickly but aren't ready to commit.
	* You want to **test something clean**, then come back to your edits later
* If your changes are already committed (you ran `git commit`), you do **not** need to stash.

|Flag|Full form|Meaning|When to use|
|---|---|---|---|
|`-u`|`--include-untracked`|Include new, untracked files in the stash|When you’ve created new files you don’t want to lose|
|`-m`|`--message`|Add a custom message/label|Always — to keep track of why you stashed|

2. **Push** - can have two different meanings
	a. ==`git push origin main` = sends commits to a *remote repository* (e.g. GitHub)==
	b. ==`git stash push` = saves your local, uncommitted changes as a *temporary stash object*==
