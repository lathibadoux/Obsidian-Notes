### Endorsements + Recommendations

Endorsements:
* Ask friends, peer, or colleagues to endorse your top skills
* ==more endorsements = higher ranking in recruiter searches==

Recommendations:
* Request short, genuine recs from mentors, classmates, or teammates
* They show social proof of your work and character

Skill Assessments:
* Take LinkedIn quizzes to earn Skill Badges
* Profiles with badges rank higher than those with just endorsements - or none at all

==Skill Badge > More Endorsements > Less Endorsements

Even small actions like these can give your profile a major visibility boost.

### Connect with the Right people

LinkedIn is not just about who you know, but its about who they know

**Who to connect with?**
* Classmates, coworkers, mentors, alumni
* Recruiters, people working at roles you want to apply for
* Join LinkedIn groups and follow industry leaders - you can message people directly who are in the same group with you
* You can look up people in specific fields or companies through the company pages

==ALWAYS make an effort to connect with people who are working in the same position you are applying for==

It will give you insights on day-to-day work and if its a good fit for you.  If you do interview, you will have an advantage over other candidates as you can add those technical and interpersonal skills to your profile.

### Why Recruiter Reach is Important

* Recruiters have a lot of influence on your job application.
* Recruiters, like most people, like to help those who help themselves - candidates who are proactive and are doing all the right things when it comes to the job search process
* NOT every recruiter will accept your request or get back to you, but a short percentage of those who do will make all the difference.

==ALWAYS REACH out to the recruiter / hiring managers==

**Step 1 - Send a connection request with a personalized message**
* Make sure the message you send is relatable, compliments the recruiter, and adds value

*In the message, don't really talk about the job posting.  The first step is all about getting the recruiter to accept your invite.
Also, keep the first message short.*

**Example:**
Hi Linda - I noticed that we both work at MNC tech companies in India and also share the same undergrad alma mater, such a nice coincidence!  I'd love to connect and stay in touch.

**Step 2 - Once you are connected with the recruiter, ask them to introduce you to someone who is working in the same role**
* Doing this is important for a couple of reasons - 
	1. You show that you are able to problem solve effectively.  You convey the fact that as an outsider you don't know anything about the role and can't make the judgement call whether you are a good fit or not.  However, you do know that the quickest way to do so is to connect with someone in the same capacity and asking them about it.
	2. You come off as polite and considerate.  Yes, you are asking for a favor, but it is better than most DMs where they ask them for a resume review or a 30 minute "quick chat about the role".
	3. Will help you stand out.

**Example:**
Hi Linda - Thanks so much for accepting my connection request!  I came across the Product Marketing Manager role posted a couple of weeks ago and I'm currently doing some research to see if it might be a good fit.
Would you happen to know someone on the team who might be open to a quick, casual chat?  I'd love to get a sense of the day-to-day and team culture before diving deeper into the application process.
As a fellow product marketer in the tech space, I really appreciate any insight you can share.  Thanks again!

**Step 3 - Follow-up with the recruiter once you have spoken with the employee
* The goal here is to stay on top of your recruiter's mind by reinforcing that you desire to join the company is now stronger than ever.
	* This works because this is very specific, you can add a CTA by asking to send your resume and adding extra skills.
	* If a recruiter denies your primary request, they would still offer you alternatives and those would be better than not messaging the recruiters at all.

**Example:**
Hi Linda - Just wanted to close the loop and share that my conversation with Jane went really well - thank you again for connecting us!
I had no idea the Android ecosystem was creating so many exciting opportunities for app developers in India, all while navigating the platform's evolving privacy and data policies.  Chatting with Jane has only deepened my interest in the Product Marketing team in Bangalore.  If it's convenient, I'd love to share my resume with you for your review.  I genuinely believe the stakeholder management skills I've developed as a Product Marketer at Amazon would transfer well to this role at Google. 
Thanks again for your support - I really appreciate it!

### Be Visible

* **Make your LinkedIn searchable**
	* To make your LinkedIn profile visible to everyone, ensure your "Public Profile" setting is active and that your profile photo visibility is set to "Everyone" or "All LinkedIn Members".  This allows all LinkedIn members to view your profile and your profile photo, regardless of whether they are in your network.

* **Show your presence online**
	* Post about your learnings in easy language.  Your posts should add value.
	* Post about relevant content to your personal brand.
	* Networking is not only about making posts. Linking, commenting, and resharing also helps as they put you in front of your second and third connections.

### Tips and Tricks

* Make sure your profile is updated and has all the relevant and recent information

* You can find people from specific companies or groups by going to their pages > people tab and then filtering down as per your requirements

* You can let companies know that you are interested by going to their pages, scrolling down and clicking on I am interested.  It stays active for a year.  Not all companies have it either.

* Your job title should be LinkedIn standard name and not something fancy that only makes sense in your company.

* **LinkedIn is your extended resume**
	* Use it to add all the in-depth details you can't add on your resume
	* Add all the projects that are not fit for your resume but add value
	* Get recommendations, endorsements from other people
	* Add your picture and a banner
	* Add your certifications and credentials
