### 009.1.3.1 SQL Interview Mistakes
1. Jumping right into coding and not asking any clarifying questions
2. Relying too heavily on engine specific UDFs
	*  Stick with ANSI-only functions and methods
3. Relying too heavily on window functions and not knowing how to replicate with regular JOINs
	* Don't necessarily expect you to get the right answer, but want to see your thought process
4. Not talking at all / being too anxious and talking too fast
	* Talk through your thought process.  Talk what you're thinking about.

### 009.1.3.2 SQL Keyword Mapping
1. Ordinal words (first, second, third, etc)
	* RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER
	* If you need 1 row per ordinal - use ROW_NUMBER
	* If you can have ties in ordinals - use DENSE_RANK
2. Rolling 7/28/30/365 day sum, average, etc
	* SUM(value) OVER (PARTITION BY dim ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 30 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
3. "Metric by Dimension"
	* Whenever you hear the word "by", think PARTITION ==BY== or GROUP ==BY==
4. Hierarchy, Funnels, month-over-month, year-over-year
	* Use a self-join or a window function
		* Interviewers often will push you to use self-join as a further optimization
	* Funnels ex.
		* You have a set of events. 
			1. Notification is sent
			2. Notification is delivered
			3. Notification is clicked
		* If you join the notification table on itself on notification ID, then you can see the flow of the events.  That is how you get all the events on the same row.
		* Once you have them on the same row, you can understand quickly like conversion rates, etc.
	* MoM and YoY process a lot of data when solved using window functions.  May get some pushback on these problems to solve a different way.
5. "Find all the things that ==don't== have X attribute"
	* LEFT JOIN + WHERE X IS NULL

### 009.1.3.3 Other things that matter
1. Query readability matters
	* Don't do nasty subqueries plz
	* Definitely use CTEs
2. Your thought process matters
3. Solving enough questions also matters
	* Aim to solve 3 to 4 questions

### 009.1.3.4 The "deep" SQL interview
* Usually 1 hour to 90 minutes
	* Usually drilled on things like:
		* Table scans
		* Indices/Partitioning
		* Optimizations
		* Query plans
			* Don't necessarily need to use the EXPLAIN keyword, but need to be able to talk about what is happening under the hood
		* Predicate put downs
* Your thought process matters more than getting a perfect answer
	* No matter how smart or good you are, they're going to take 60 - 90 minutes
* Be personable and likable
	* The interviewer grades you on a 4 scale
		* 1 strong pass
		* 2 weak pass
		* 3 week accept
		* 4 strong accept
	* How likable you are could mean the difference between 2 and 3 if you were really on the edge on some of the problems.
		* Maybe try to get them to laugh
		* Bring your passion and your fire
* Ask for your interviews to not be back-to-back the whole day so your brain can refresh and recharge for at least 30 minutes between interviews.
	* Ex. one hour of interview and 30 minute break between interviews
* Exercise for 30+ minutes before any "onsite" technical interview to reduce anxiety and jitters.
