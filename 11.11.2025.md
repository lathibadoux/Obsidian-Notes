🤖 On October 20th, I joined [@Zach Wilson] intensive **AI Engineering Bootcamp**. I wasn't sure what to expect since my prior experience with AI was limited — but it’s turned out to be one of the most exciting and rewarding learning experiences of my career! 😊

What I’ve loved most is how _hands-on_ this program is. It’s easy to get lost in a sea of AI theory without ever learning how to actually productionize AI products. Personally, the only way I can learn tech is by _doing_ tech — and this bootcamp nails that balance perfectly.

So far, I’ve learned how to:

- Design **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** systems
    
- Build **FastAPI** apps that integrate with **OpenAI’s GPT models**
    
- Implement **embeddings, similarity search, and reranking** pipelines
    

I’ve followed Zach’s work for a couple of years, so I was already familiar with the high quality of his data engineering content. There are so many emerging voices in the AI space and countless programs to choose from — but I chose this one because Zach approaches AI from a **data engineering** perspective, focusing on the systems and pipelines that make AI possible. 

His next AI Engineering Bootcamp kicks off **March 16th**, and if you’re on the fence, take this as your sign — it’s one of the best investments I’ve made in my career. 🚀
