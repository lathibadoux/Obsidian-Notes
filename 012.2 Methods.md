### 012.2.1 What is a method

All **methods** are functions - 
but **not all functions** are methods.

* A **method** is a function that's defined *inside* a class - so it automatically gets access to the object it belongs to (through the parameter `self`).
* Method = a function that belongs to an object or class

**Example:**
```python
class Greeter:
    def greet(self, name):
        return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

You call it *through the object*:
```python
bot = Greeter()
bot.greet("Leigh")
```

* `greet()` is a **method** because it's part of the `Greeter` class.
* It's still a *function under the hood*, but Python gives it special access to the object (`self`).
