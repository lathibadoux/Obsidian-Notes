## 001.2.1.1 Nested Loops
### Mechanism:
* The simplest join algorithm.
* Iterates through each row of the ==outer table== (usually the smaller one) and for each row searches for matching rows in the inner table.
* If an index exists on the join column of the inner table, it can perform an index seek, making it highly efficient for small results sets.

### Best Use Cases:
1. Joining a small outer with a larger inner table that has an index on the join column.
2. Queries that return a small number of rows from the outer table.
3. When the join condition involves a range comparison 
	* BETWEEN, >, <

## 001.2.1.2 Merge Joins

### Mechanism:
* Requires both input tables to be sorted on their join columns.
* Efficiently merges the sorted tables, comparing rows from both tables simultaneously.

### Best Use Cases:
1. Joining large tables that are already sorted on their join columns
	*  Due to a CREATE INDEX or a prior ORDER BY clause
2. When performing equality or range joins on presorted data.

## 001.2.1.3 Hash Match Joins

### Mechanism:

### Best Use Cases:
1. Joining large, unsorted, and unindexed tables, especially when one table is significantly smaller than the other
2. Primarily used for equality joins
3. Often chosen as a fallback when other join methods are not feasible or efficient
