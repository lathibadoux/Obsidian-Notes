### Overview

✏️ Edit → ✅ Stage → 💾 Commit → ☁️ Push

### Path A - stash first, then update, then commit
	Best when you're not sure what changed or if you might have conflicts.

1. **Confirm where you are:**
```bash
git status
git branch -vv
git remote -v
```

2. **Stash ALL local work (tracked + untracked)**
```bash
git stash push -u -m "WIP before pulling (YYYY-MM-DD)" #stashes tracked and untracked changes
```

3. **Update your local main from the remote (cleanly)**
```bash
git fetch origin #gets updates from the remote repo
git checkout main #switches to main branch (if not already on main branch)
git pull --rebase origin main
```
