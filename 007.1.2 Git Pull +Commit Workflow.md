### 1️⃣ Make sure your remotes are set correctly

`git remote -v`

You should see:

`origin   https://github.com/lathibadoux/ai-application-october-2025.git (fetch) origin   https://github.com/lathibadoux/ai-application-october-2025.git (push) upstream https://github.com/DataExpert-io/ai-application-october-2025.git (fetch) upstream https://github.com/DataExpert-io/ai-application-october-2025.git (push)`

✅ If not, add upstream:

`git remote add upstream https://github.com/DataExpert-io/ai-application-october-2025.git`

---

### 2️⃣ Commit your changes

Make sure you’re on the branch you want to update (usually `main`):

`git status`

Then stage and commit your work:

`git add . git commit -m "Describe your changes"`

---

### 3️⃣ Fetch the latest updates from Zach’s repo

This pulls his latest commits into your local Git database:

`git fetch upstream`

---

### 4️⃣ Merge the updates into your local branch

While on your local `main`:

`git checkout main git merge upstream/main`

- If there are **no conflicts**, Git merges automatically.
    
- If there **are conflicts**, VS Code will highlight them — you can choose “Accept Incoming,” “Accept Current,” or “Accept Both.”
    

---

### 5️⃣ Push your updated branch to _your_ GitHub fork

Once everything looks good:

`git push origin main`

This updates your GitHub repo (`origin`) with the merged result — it does **not** affect Zach’s repo.

---

### ⚙️ Optional: If you have uncommitted local changes

If you forgot to commit before merging:

`git stash git pull upstream main git stash pop`

Then resolve any conflicts, commit, and push.
