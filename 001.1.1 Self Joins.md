**Use cases for a self-join**
	*If you're working with data that has any internal relationships, sequences, or comparisons
1. ==Hierarchical Data (i.e. employees & managers)==
	SELECT e.Name AS Employee, m.Name AS Manager
	FROM Employees e
	JOIN Employees m ON e.ManagerID = m.EmployeeID;
2. ==Comparing Rows in the Same Table==
	1. Example: Find all pairs of products from the same category but different prices:
		SELECT p1.ProductName, p2.ProductName
		FROM Products p1
		JOIN Products p2 ON p1.CategoryID = p2.CategoryID
		WHERE p1.Price < p2.Price; 
3. ==Find Time Gaps or Sequences
	1. Example: Find the next event for a user:
		SELECT a.UserID, a.EventTime AS CurrentEvent, b.EventTime AS NextEvent
		FROM Events a
		JOIN Events b ON a.UserID = b.UserID AND b.EventTime > a.EventTime
		WHERE NOT EXISTS (
		    SELECT 1 FROM Events c 
		    WHERE c.UserID = a.UserID AND c.EventTime > a.EventTime AND c.EventTime < b.EventTime
		);
4. ==Detecting Duplicates or Similar Rows
	1. Example: Find students with the same last name and birthdate:
		SELECT s1.StudentID, s2.StudentID
		FROM Students s1
		JOIN Students s2 
		  ON s1.LastName = s2.LastName 
		 AND s1.BirthDate = s2.BirthDate
		WHERE s1.StudentID < s2.StudentID;
5. ==Pairwise Combinations
	1. Example: List all possible matches between players in a tournament:
		SELECT a.PlayerName AS Player1, b.PlayerName AS Player2
		FROM Players a
		JOIN Players b ON a.PlayerID < b.PlayerID;
6. ==Finding Extremes with Respect to a Group
	1. Example: Find employees who earn more than their department's average:
		SELECT e1.*
		FROM Employees e1
		JOIN Employees e2 ON e1.DepartmentID = e2.DepartmentID
		GROUP BY e1.EmployeeID, e1.Salary
		HAVING e1.Salary > AVG(e2.Salary);
