💡 Knowledge sticks when something is explained in multiple times in different ways. This article stands out not because it covers the hottest trending topic (looking at you, AI), but because of how it restates fundamental data engineering principles in an exceptionally digestible way.

⏳ If you have 15 free minutes, I highly recommend you give it a read.
