* Docker has a client - server component.  
* The server is called a ==Docker engine==.
	* The server takes care of running and building containers.
* All the containers share the same kernel (engine) of the host OS
	* A ==kernel== is the part of the OS that manages applications and hardware resources
	* Different kernels (i.e. Windows, Linux, Mach) have different APIs
		* This is why you cannot run Windows application on a Linux machine
	* The container type will be dictated by the host OS
