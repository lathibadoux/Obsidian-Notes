## Assignment Instructions

**Prompting - file you need to submit is prompts.md**
- Prompt engineer the following question so it consistently answers the question right the first time. What country has the same letter repeated the most in its name?
- Try different models, which one performs better?
- Try using GPT-5 and prompt engineering to get a more accurate answer.
- In your prompts.md file include:
- The best performing models you tried
- The prompt engineered version to get GPT-5 to work better
- The actual answer to the question
    
**Vibe Coding - file you need to submit is main.py** 
- Follow the exercises in lab 2 where we resume parser
- Extend the `/api/parse-resume` end point to accept images and PDFs to make the AI truly multi-modal.
- Note - OpenAI handles PDFs through the Files API and images through base64 encoding.

## AI Feedback

### 📄 prompts.md

**What You Submitted**

- Mentions of higher-performing models with examples of variants you tested
    
- Clear example prompts demonstrating prompt-engineering techniques:
    
    - Explicit **task statement** and **instruction list** constrained to UN M49 English country list
        
    - Required use of full official country names
        
    - Step-by-step decomposition and tie-handling criteria
        
    - Worked examples to show expected output format
        
- Includes at least one required country name explicitly (rubric requirement met)
    

**Evaluation**

- ✅ Strong prompt-engineering structure with clear decomposition and examples
    
- ✅ Task framing and constraints follow rubric expectations
    
- ✅ Demonstrates awareness of model selection and comparative performance
    

**Suggestions**

- Add **guardrails** such as explicit output schema instructions and a “no chain-of-thought” clause if you want strict, parse-ready output
    
- Briefly explain **why** the chosen models performed better (e.g., reasoning, token window, multimodal ability)

### ⚙️ main.py

**What You Submitted**

- FastAPI endpoint `/api/parse-resume` correctly accepts a file via `multipart/form-data (UploadFile)` with optional `html_content` fallback
    
- **PDF handling:** uploads to the OpenAI Files API, retrieves `file_id`, and passes to completions endpoint; cleans up temporary file afterward ✅
    
- **Image handling:** base64-encodes images and includes as a data URL in the messages array ✅
    
- **Additional strengths**
    
    - Good use of **tools schema** for structured output
        
    - Fallback logic when no `tool_call` is produced
        
    - Inserts parsed JSON into Supabase and returns clean response
        

**Suggestions / Improvements**

- **API compatibility:** Some SDK versions may not support passing `file_id` directly to `chat.completions`; if issues arise, use either
    
    - the **Assistants API** for end-to-end file parsing, or
        
    - the **Responses API** (supports multimodal inputs with file references)
        
- **MIME detection:** derive actual MIME type from upload (avoid always using `image/jpeg`)
    
- **Error handling and cleanup:**
    
    - Move file deletion into a `finally` block
        
    - Catch `json.JSONDecodeError` explicitly when parsing responses
        
- **Security and robustness:**
    
    - Add file-size and content-type limits
        
    - Sanitize PII and log carefully
        
- **Developer Experience:**
    
    - Document expected multipart field names and include a sample `curl` request for PDF + image
        
    - Return clearer errors when no `tool_calls` are present

### 🧪 If Testing Fails / Debug Checklist

If you encounter runtime issues, include:

1. Sample `curl` or Postman request (headers + form fields)
    
2. Exact error message / stack trace
    
3. Your `openai`, `fastapi`, and `openai-python` SDK versions
    
4. File type and redacted filename or MIME type
