## Definition
An index is a data structure that provides quick access to data, optimizing the speed of your queries.

## B-Tree
- A **B-tree** (short for _balanced tree_) is a self-balancing search tree that keeps data sorted and allows efficient **inserts, deletes, and lookups** — typically in _O(log n)_ time.
- The leaf nodes contain the actual data (the data pages)
- The intermediate and root nodes are the index pages
