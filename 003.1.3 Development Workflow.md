1. Take an application and =="Dockerize"== it by adding a Dockerfile
	* A ==Dockerfile== is a plain text file that contains instructions that allow Docker to package up your application into an ==Image== file.
	* The Image file contains everything the application needs to run.
		* A cut-down OS
		* A runtime environment (i.e. Node)
		* Application file
		* Third-party libraries
		* Environment variables
2. Once you have an image, you tell docker to start a container using that image.  We can then tell Docker to run the application inside the container.
3. Once you have the image, you can push it to ==DockerHub==.  DockerHub is like GitHub is for Git.  It's a storage for docker images that anyone can use.
	* Once the application is on DockerHub, then you can put the application on any machines running Docker.
