1. Avoid over indexing.  Too many indexes slow down the INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.  Will also confuse the execution plan about choosing the right index.  
2. Monitor the usage of the indexes.  Drop unused indexes.
3. Update the statistics (weekly).  This will prevent an optimal execution plan for your queries.
4. Reorganize and rebuild indexes (weekly).  Prevents data fragmentation in your indexes.
5. Partition large tables (fact tables) to improve performance.  Apply a Columnstore index for best results.
