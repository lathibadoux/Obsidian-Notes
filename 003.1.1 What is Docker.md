* A ==container== is an isolated environment for running an application
	* A container is just a process running on your computer
	* Allow running multiple apps in isolation
	* Are lightweight
	* Use the same OS of the host
	* Starts quickly
	* Need less hardware resources
* A ==virtual machine== is an abstraction of a machine (physical hardware)
	* Can run several machines on one machine.  
	* Creates an isolated environment where you can run applications
	* Ex.  Have a Mac, but can run Windows and Linux
	* ==Hypervisor== is software that is used to create and run virtual machines
		* VirtualBox
		* VMware
		* Hyper-v (Windows only)
	* Problems:
		* Each VM needs a full-blow OS
		* Slow to start
		* Resource intensive
